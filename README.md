# Afterglow UI
###### An Atom UI Theme - [Atom.io](https://atom.io/packages/afterglow-ui) : [Github](https://github.com/dsandstrom/atom-afterglow-ui)

A minimal dark syntax theme converted from [Afterglow](https://github.com/YabataDesign/afterglow-theme) (Sublime Text).

I made a UI theme to match the syntax theme that looks similar to the Sublime Text version.  However, I took some liberties and not really finished.  I decided to upload what I have and hope that will push me to spend more time perfecting it.

### Notes
* Made to match [Afterglow Syntax](https://atom.io/packages/afterglow-syntax)
* In beta, issues and pull requests are welcome.
